<h3>eTracker would not allow you to sign in if it detects that you
are accessing eTracker through another tab of the same browser when you
are already signed in or if your browser uses same session in which you
or someone is signed in. This is done to protect your eTracker account,
and to ensure the privacy of your information. <br>
<br>
<br>
To avoid this you need to logout from eTracker in which you signed in a
while ago.</h3>
